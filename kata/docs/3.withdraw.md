## Withdraw
Let's think about test cases for the withdraw:
```text
Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account"
Existing account -> return a failure for a withdraw of 0
Existing account with not enough money & a withdraw of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" 
Existing account with enough money & a withdraw of 900 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 900
```

Let's create a new test class `WithdrawShould`

### Non-passing tests
:red_circle: Let's write our first test (Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account")

```scala
class WithdrawShould
    extends AnyFlatSpec
    with MockFactory
    with EitherValues
    with Matchers
    with OneInstancePerTest {
  private val anAccountId = UUID.randomUUID()
  private val accountRepositoryStub = stub[AccountRepository]
  private val withdrawUseCase = new WithdrawUseCase()

  it should "return a failure for a non existing account" in {
    notExistingAccount()
    withdrawUseCase
      .invoke(Withdraw(anAccountId, 100))
      .left
      .get mustBe "Unknown account"
  }

  private def notExistingAccount(): Unit =
    (accountRepositoryStub.find _)
      .when(anAccountId)
      .returns(None)
}
```

:green_circle: We need to adapt our UseCase to make it return an `Either[String, Account]`
```scala
class WithdrawUseCase() {
  def invoke(withdraw: Withdraw): Either[String, Account] =
    Left("Unknown account")
}
```

:large_blue_circle: We have use some copy / paste for this test
Let's centralize some useful code shared between tests and usecases
