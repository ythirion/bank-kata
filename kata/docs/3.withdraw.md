## Withdraw
Let's think about test cases for the withdrawal:
```text
Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account"
Existing account -> return a failure for a withdrawal of 0
Existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" 
Existing account with enough money & a withdrawal of 900 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 900
```

Let's create a new test class `WithdrawShould`

### Non-passing tests
:red_circle: Let's write our first test (Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account")

```scala
class WithdrawShould
    extends AnyFlatSpec
    with MockFactory
    with EitherValues
    with Matchers
    with OneInstancePerTest {
  private val anAccountId = UUID.randomUUID()
  private val accountRepositoryStub = stub[AccountRepository]
  private val withdrawUseCase = new WithdrawUseCase()

  it should "return a failure for a non existing account" in {
    notExistingAccount()
    withdrawUseCase
      .invoke(Withdraw(anAccountId, 100))
      .left
      .get mustBe "Unknown account"
  }

  private def notExistingAccount(): Unit =
    (accountRepositoryStub.find _)
      .when(anAccountId)
      .returns(None)
}
```

:green_circle: We need to adapt our UseCase to make it return an `Either[String, Account]`
```scala
class WithdrawUseCase() {
  def invoke(withdraw: Withdraw): Either[String, Account] =
    Left("Unknown account")
}
```

Update our test list.

```text
✅ Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account"
Existing account -> return a failure for a withdrawal of 0
Existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" 
Existing account with enough money & a withdrawal of 900 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 900
```

:large_blue_circle: We have used some "copy / paste" for this test.

Let's centralize some useful code shared between tests through a `trait` that we can call `AccountUseCaseTest`.

```scala
trait AccountUseCaseTest extends MockFactory {
  protected val anAccountId: UUID = UUID.randomUUID()
  protected val accountRepositoryStub: AccountRepository =
    stub[AccountRepository]

  protected def notExistingAccount(): Unit =
    (accountRepositoryStub.find _)
      .when(anAccountId)
      .returns(None)

  protected def existingAccount(transactions: Transaction*): Unit =
    (accountRepositoryStub.find _)
      .when(anAccountId)
      .returns(
        Some(
          AccountBuilder
            .aNewAccount(anAccountId)
            .containing(transactions.toList)
            .build()
        )
      )
}
```

:red_circle: Let's add another test(Existing account -> return a failure for a withdrawal of 0)
```scala
  it should "return a failure for an existing account and a withdrawal of <= 0" in {
    existingAccount()
    assertErrorForNegativeOrEqualTo0Amount(0, -1, -1000, NegativeInfinity)
  }

  private def assertErrorForNegativeOrEqualTo0Amount(
      invalidAmounts: Double*
  ): Unit =
    invalidAmounts.foreach { invalidAmount =>
      withdrawUseCase
        .invoke(Withdraw(anAccountId, invalidAmount))
        .left
        .get mustBe "Invalid amount for withdraw"
    }
```

:green_circle: We adapt the use case to pass the repository instance and implement basic pattern matching
```scala
class WithdrawUseCase(accountRepository: AccountRepository) {
  def invoke(withdraw: Withdraw): Either[String, Account] =
    accountRepository.find(withdraw.accountId) match {
      case Some(account) => Left("Invalid amount for withdraw")
      case None          => Left("Unknown account")
    }
}
```

```text
✅ Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account"
✅ Existing account -> return a failure for a withdrawal of 0
Existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" 
Existing account with enough money & a withdrawal of 900 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 900
```

:large_blue_circle: We can centralize the way we assert non-passing test cases for invalid amount
```scala
trait AccountUseCaseTest extends MockFactory with Matchers {
  ...
  protected def assertErrorForNegativeOrEqualTo0Amount[TCommand](
      commandFactory: Double => TCommand,
      useCase: TCommand => Either[String, Account],
      expectedMessage: String,
      invalidAmounts: Double*
  ): Unit =
    invalidAmounts.foreach { invalidAmount =>
      useCase(commandFactory(invalidAmount)).left.get mustBe expectedMessage
    }
}
```

And to use it
```scala
  it should "return a failure for an existing account and a withdrawal of <= 0" in {
    existingAccount()

    assertErrorForNegativeOrEqualTo0Amount[Withdraw](
      invalidAmount => Withdraw(anAccountId, invalidAmount),
      withdraw => withdrawUseCase.invoke(withdraw),
      "Invalid amount for withdraw",
      0,
      -1,
      -1000,
      NegativeInfinity
    )
  }
```

:red_circle: Let's add another test(Existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" )
```scala
  it should "return a failure because not enough money available for an existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100" in {
    existingAccount()

    withdrawUseCase
      .invoke(createWithdrawCommand(100))
      .left
      .get mustBe "Not enough money to withdraw 100.0"
  }
```

:green_circle: We adapt the use case to delegate business logi to the `Account`

```scala
class WithdrawUseCase(accountRepository: AccountRepository) {
  def invoke(withdraw: Withdraw): Either[String, Account] =
    accountRepository.find(withdraw.accountId) match {
      case Some(account) => account.withdraw(withdraw.amount)
      case None          => Left("Unknown account")
    }
}
```

And implement `withdraw` behavior

```scala
  def withdraw(amount: Double): Either[String, Account] = {
    if (amount <= 0) Left("Invalid amount for withdraw")
    else Left(s"Not enough money to withdraw $amount")
  }
```

```text
✅ Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account"
✅ Existing account -> return a failure for a withdrawal of 0
✅ Existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" 
Existing account with enough money & a withdrawal of 900 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 900
```

:large_blue_circle: Any refactoring?
We already have some duplication in the `Account` class.

```scala
case class Account(id: UUID, transactions: List[Transaction] = List()) {
  def deposit(clock: Clock, amount: Double): Either[String, Account] = {
    if (amount <= 0) Left("Invalid amount for deposit")
    else
      Right(
        copy(transactions = Transaction(clock.now(), amount) :: transactions)
      )
  }

  def withdraw(amount: Double): Either[String, Account] = {
    if (amount <= 0) Left("Invalid amount for withdraw")
    else Left(s"Not enough money to withdraw $amount")
  }
}
```

Let's refactor it with continuation function
```scala
case class Account(id: UUID, transactions: List[Transaction] = List()) {
  def deposit(clock: Clock, amount: Double): Either[String, Account] =
    validateAmount(amount, "Invalid amount for deposit") { validAmount =>
      Right(
        copy(transactions =
          Transaction(clock.now(), validAmount) :: transactions
        )
      )
    }

  def withdraw(amount: Double): Either[String, Account] = {
    validateAmount(amount, "Invalid amount for withdraw") { validAmount =>
      Left(s"Not enough money to withdraw $validAmount")
    }
  }

  private def validateAmount(amount: Double, invalidAmountMessage: String)(
      onValidAmount: Double => Either[String, Account]
  ): Either[String, Account] =
    if (isValidAmount(amount)) onValidAmount(amount)
    else Left(invalidAmountMessage)

  private def isValidAmount(amount: Double) = amount > 0
}
```

### Passing test(s)
:red_circle: Let's write our next test (Existing account with enough money & a withdrawal of 900 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 900)

```scala
  it should "store the updated account containing a Transaction(transactionTime, -900) for an existing account containing enough money to withdraw" in {
    val formerTransactions =
      List(aNewTransaction().of(500).build(), aNewTransaction().of(500).build())

    existingAccount(formerTransactions)

    val newAccount = withdrawUseCase.invoke(createWithdrawCommand(900))

    newAccount.right.value.transactions mustBe Transaction(
      transactionTime,
      -900
    ) :: formerTransactions
    (accountRepositoryStub.save _)
      .verify(newAccount.right.value)
      .once()
  }
```

Let's change our `Account` implementation
```scala
  def containsEnoughMoney(amount: Double): Boolean =
    transactions.map(_.amount).sum >= amount

  def withdraw(clock: Clock, amount: Double): Either[String, Account] = {
    validateAmount(amount, "Invalid amount for withdraw") { validAmount =>
      if (!containsEnoughMoney(validAmount))
        Left(s"Not enough money to withdraw $validAmount")
      else
        Right(
          copy(transactions =
            Transaction(clock.now(), validAmount) :: transactions
          )
        )
    }
  }
```

- We need to adapt the callers to pass the `clock` parameter as well
- Adapt the use case to store the result in the `AccountRepository`

```scala

class WithdrawUseCase(accountRepository: AccountRepository, clock: Clock) {
  def invoke(withdraw: Withdraw): Either[String, Account] =
    accountRepository.find(withdraw.accountId) match {
      case Some(account) => withdrawSafely(withdraw, account)
      case None          => Left("Unknown account")
    }

  private def withdrawSafely(
      withdraw: Withdraw,
      account: Account
  ): Either[String, Account] = {
    account.withdraw(clock, withdraw.amount) match {
      case Right(updatedAccount) =>
        accountRepository.save(updatedAccount)
        Right(updatedAccount)
      case Left(error) => Left(error)
    }
  }
}
```

:large_blue_circle: Remove duplication in `Account` (Transaction creation)
```scala
case class Account(id: UUID, transactions: List[Transaction] = List()) {
  def deposit(clock: Clock, amount: Double): Either[String, Account] =
    validateAmount(amount, "Invalid amount for deposit") { validAmount =>
      addTransaction(clock, validAmount)
    }

  def withdraw(clock: Clock, amount: Double): Either[String, Account] = {
    validateAmount(amount, "Invalid amount for withdraw") { validAmount =>
      if (!containsEnoughMoney(validAmount))
        Left(s"Not enough money to withdraw $validAmount")
      else addTransaction(clock, -validAmount)
    }
  }

  private def validateAmount(amount: Double, invalidAmountMessage: String)(
      onValidAmount: Double => Either[String, Account]
  ): Either[String, Account] =
    if (!isValidAmount(amount)) Left(invalidAmountMessage)
    else onValidAmount(amount)

  private def isValidAmount(amount: Double) = amount > 0

  private def containsEnoughMoney(amount: Double): Boolean =
    transactions.map(_.amount).sum >= amount

  private def addTransaction(clock: Clock, validAmount: Double) = {
    Right(
      copy(transactions =
        Transaction(clock.now(), validAmount) :: transactions
      )
    )
  }
}
```

We can use the same `assertAccountHasBeenCorrectlyUpdated` in both our use case tests

```text
✅ Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account"
✅ Existing account -> return a failure for a withdrawal of 0
✅ Existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" 
✅ Existing account with enough money & a withdrawal of 900 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 900
```

### What next?

![thinker](../../img/think.png)

By having added the `containsEnoughMoney` we have seen that we can identify an interesting test case: what happen if we want to withdraw the exact amount available in the account?

```text
✅ Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account"
✅ Existing account -> return a failure for a withdrawal of 0
✅ Existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" 
Existing account containing 1000 for a withdrawal of 1000 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 1000
```

:green_circle: Let's add this test case to improve our confidence in the implementation
```scala
  it should "be able to withdrawal the whole account amount" in {
    val formerTransaction = aNewTransaction().of(1000).build()

    existingAccount(formerTransaction)

    val newAccount =
      withdrawUseCase.invoke(createWithdrawCommand(formerTransaction.amount))

    assertAccountHasBeenCorrectlyUpdated(
      newAccount,
      List(
        Transaction(
          transactionTime,
          -1000
        ),
        formerTransaction
      )
    )
  }
```

```text
✅ Not existing account -> return a failure "Unknown account"
✅ Existing account -> return a failure for a withdrawal of 0
✅ Existing account with not enough money & a withdrawal of 100 -> return a failure because "not enough money available" 
✅ Existing account containing 1000 for a withdrawal of 1000 -> store the updated account containing a negative transaction of 1000
```
